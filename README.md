# Covid-19 Dashboard

Coronavirus Dashboard on Mobile

## Getting Started

This project is not yet an optimized (code) project.

I tried to adapt the BLoC architect, however, after unsuccessfully publishing the app due to violation of Google Sensitive Events policy, I stopped working on this project.

The project was ignited by Flutter/Dart.

The Covid-19 Data source API I use in the project is from:
- [covid19 API](https://github.com/ChrisMichaelPerezSantiago/covid19)

## TESTING
You may download the *app-release.apk* in this root directory and install into your Android device for testing.
